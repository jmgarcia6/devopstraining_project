The DevOps Certification Training (Oct09-Nov27 2021) of Jos√© Maria Garcia have been delivered. The project's repository can be found in https://github.com/jmgarcia6/devopstraining_project. It is possible to find the following files: Readme.md, main.tf, outputs.tf, ssh_private_key_file.ssh, variables.tf and versions.tf. I have launched an EC2 instance using Terraform, I have connect to the instance and I have installed the Jenkins, Java, and Python in the same instance.
